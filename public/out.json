    "act": "Division and Classification",
    "components": "Population Registration Act of 1950",
    "summary": "Classified all citizens into 3 groups, white, coloured, or bantu, and made it so that tests had to be taken if they wanted to reclassify into another race",
    "category": "Petty Apartheid, Social",
    "reasoning": "This law affected South Africans socially because it gave whites freedom while other races were free of any outside blood. This was petty apartheid because it disadvantaged people, and oftentimes babies were separated from families due to changes in complexion everyday, just due to fussy tests"
  },
  {
    "act": "Prohibition of Mixed Marriages",
    "components": "Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act and Immorality Act of 1949",
    "summary": "Made it illegal for whites to be in a relationship with a different race, punishible by fines and jail time",
    "category": "Petty Apartheid, Social, Economical",
    "reasoning": "The goal was to separate races, and to make them feel like they had no power. Relationships are obviously social. Second, peoples house were often broken into by the police, this is clearly a show of dominance by the government that hurt people's perception of their own privacy. They would also be fined severely if caught, which also hurts them economically"
  },
  {
    "act": "Separate Amenities",
    "components": "Reservation of Amenities Act of 1953",
    "summary": "Made all public facilities segregated",
    "category": "Petty Apartheid, Social",
    "reasoning": "It was petty by nature because segregation even applied to benches or water fountains. Second, the white facilities were often a much better standard than the ones given to non-whites, making non-whites feel demeaned and inferior, while also separating the opportunities for whites and non-whites to meet together, so they were segregated"
  },
  {
    "act": "Pass Laws",
    "components": "The Natives (Abolition of Passes and Co-ordination of Documents) Act of 1952, or Pass Laws Act",
    "summary": "This act forced non-whites to have reference books instead of passes, which required more information. Non-whites were only allowed to enter cities if they were given a stamp stating that they were looking for work, if they didn't find work within a certain amount of time they would be arrested",
    "category": "Grand Apartheid, Social, Economical",
    "reasoning": "This act had a social impact, because whites did not have to have these passes, implying that they were beyond thes things. It also allowed the government to control the movement of non-whites and enforce segregation more easily. The act also had an economical impact because the opportunities of non-whites to find work in the city would be severely limited. This act is part of Grand Apartheid because it's name was very misleading and it separated non-whites from the city"
  },
  {
    "act": "Group Areas",
    "components": "Group Areas Act of 1950",
    "summary": "This act was based on the racist idea that Africans were a rural people and didn't belong in cities. They were forcefully relocated and segregated by white people to live on the outskirts of the city",
    "category": "Grand Apartheid, Economical",
    "reasoning": "This act had a huge economical impact on non-whites. Some owned businesses in town and were forced to move and shut down their businesses, to the glee of the white businesses that supported the bill. It basically allowed whites to reap all the economical benefits of cheap labor provided by non-whites without actually working. Many others lost their established life and had to find new jobs. This was definitely part of Grand Apartheid from the territorial segregation based on a racist premise"
  },
  {
    "act": "Bantu Education",
    "components": "Bantu Education Act of 1953",
    "summary": "This act only allowed schools to admit students from one racial group, and a different curriculum given to each racial group. It put the power from the ministry of education into government authority and people in full support of apartheid",
    "category": "Petty Apartheid, Social, Economical",
    "reasoning": "This act had a huge economical and social impact on non-whites. Non-whites were taught curriculums that only included basic household and domestic skills, with an expectation that they would go on to serve white families, and that was all that they were intellectually capable of. This act is part of petty apartheid because it gives non-whites less opportunity and is very demeaning."
  },
  {
    "act": "University Education",
    "components": "The Extension of University Education Act of 1959",
    "summary": "This act extended the Bantu Education Act, forcing the small number of universities to that were registering students of all races to stop doing so. For African universities, only a single tribe was allowed into a university.",
    "category": "Petty Apartheid, Political, Economical, Social",
    "reasoning": "This act had an effect on the political, economical, and social environment of south africa because it further self-containerized each race and tribe into their own area, political and economically, while having a huge social impact on universities"
  },
  {
    "act": "Bantu Authority",
    "components": "The Bantu Authorities Act and the Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act 1951",
    "summary": "This act designated each non-white person their own homelands to govern, turning native reserves into full states. Black people were no longer citizens of Africa but instead citizens of Bantusan",
    "category": "Grand Apartheid, Political, Economical, Social",
    "reasoning": "This act was definitely instrumental and core to Apartheid and is definitely part of Grand Apartheid. On the surface homelands were given independence, but in reality each government was corrupt and backed by the actual South African government. It took away political rights from non-whites, since they were seen as citizens of a different country. It also had a social impact since at any moment in time non-whites living in the city could be deported. Finally, non-whites, who made up the majority of South Africa, were given just 13% of the total land, and on top of that, this land was extremely inarable. On the flipside, they could be exploited for cheap labor even more as they were not considered Africans, yet another negative economical impact"

  {
    "act": "Repressive Laws",
    "components": "Suppression of Communism Act of 1950",
    "summary": "This act defined communism so broadly that any protest against apartheid could be seen as communism. \"Anything that involved 'the promotion of disturbances or disorder' would fall under this law\"",
    "category": "Petty Apartheid, Political",
    "reasoning": "This act had a huge political impact on apartheid, as it was basically used as an excuse to silence any opposition to apartheid from non-whites via prosecution or banishment"
  },
  {
    "act": "Censorship Laws",
    "components": "Customs of Excise act of 1955 and Official Secrets Act of 1956",
    "summary": "This act instated a board of censors that could ban anything that they wanted to, imported or native",
    "category": "Petty Apartheid, Social, Political",
    "reasoning": "This act definitely had a political impact on the people. It aimed to shield whites from the freedom of expression in other countries that might negatively impact their morals or anything remotely related to race that the government didn't like. It also had a social impact because it treated blacks and white unequally"
